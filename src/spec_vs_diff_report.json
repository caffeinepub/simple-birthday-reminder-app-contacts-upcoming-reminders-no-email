  "summary": "The diff does not fully remove/clean up the domain-configuration feature set: multiple domain-related components/hooks/libs remain and were modified, indicating domain functionality is still present in the codebase and likely not fully cleaned up per requirements.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Clean up unused domain-related frontend code paths after removing the domain UI entry point (components/hooks/utilities) so the frontend builds without unused-import/lint errors and no longer makes domain-related backend calls from the UI.",
      "reason": "Domain-related UI and supporting code paths still exist (and were modified), which suggests the domain feature was not cleaned up/removed and may still be callable from the UI or at least remains as dead/unused code rather than being removed.",

    {
      "description": "Continued/expanded in-app domain apply flow UI (suggested/custom slug selection, apply action, success state with final URL + copy-to-clipboard, retry/error states).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest asks to remove the in-app domain configuration flow; retaining or further implementing the full domain-apply UI is out of scope and conflicts with the removal goal.",

    {
      "description": "Domain slug suggestion fetching/validation behavior (regex validation and client-side fallback generation to produce exactly 5 candidates).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly focuses on removing domain UI and cleaning up domain-related code paths; enhancing domain slug suggestion logic is not requested and works against the intended removal.",
